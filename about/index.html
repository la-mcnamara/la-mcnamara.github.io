title: About Me
---

<h1>Nice to meet you.</h1>
<p>I'm a data scientist interested in healthcare, sociology, and AI Ethics. I have spent nearly all of my career working in health or healthcare, first in survey research, then in hospital performance improvement, and currently at a major insurance payor. I love working at the intersection of technology and sociology and using my technical talent to build products that help people. I serve as chair of the AI Ethics Committee at my company and am excited to work towards building fair and and unbiased models in a very practical and applied setting.</p>

<p> When not working, you will probably find me reading (mostly sci-fi), watching Star Trek, or walking my dog.</p>
